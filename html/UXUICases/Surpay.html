                We used the Agile methodology and tracked the process with Trello. As the research and designer, I split my tasks into 4 sections:
                <b>basic layout research, low fidelity wireframe design, detailed research for design and UI concepts,</b> and the <b>high fidelity prototype.</b>
                I met with Alan and Keegan via Discord where we discussed the concept of Surpay and the functionalities they had already developed for the app. 
                While I worked on the UXUI research & design, Alan and Keegan worked on the backend functionalities and database. For the login, they mentioned that they only needed
                to collect user or company names, password, email, and wallet information (making this optional for users who do not want it to be 
                saved in the database).

                    My first steps included researching popular survey sites and a few cryptocurrency websites.
                    These included Google & SurveyMonkey for surveys, and OneOf, Sushi, and Uniswap for 
                    cryptocurrency exchange websites. This was a crucial step as I did not have any experience 
                    with cryptocurrency prior to working on this application. I took notes of their layouts, color palettes, user 
                    experience, and navigation to understand why certain design elements were chosen and how it made the user experience
                    differ from other financial applications. 
                    <!-- While both have different design elements from one another because 
                    they cater to different areas in technology, I made sure to write down the layout differences
                    in order to pick and choose which would be best for the Surpay application when designing the wireframe. -->

                <p id="fontSize">
                    I wrote down the general design similarities for each category 
                    (survey vs cryptocurrency websites) in order to select and combine components for the Surpay wireframe. 
                    Each website has different design elements because they cater to different areas in technology. 
                    It was both interesting and difficult to piece components together because the two categories greatly differ from one another.
                    Survey websites are more complex, contain more information, more pages, and a fuller homepage. Cryptocurrency websites on 
                    the other hand are more minimalistic, with little description, fewer pages, and a cleaner homepage.

                   I decided to combine the themes of common survey sites and crypto exchange sites. In order to do this, I created 
                   a low fidelity wireframe with a dark themed background and light themed modals, dashboards, and overlays for a sharper 
                   contrast.  We wanted users to feel as though they were taking surveys
                    from trusted survey sites, but to have the feel of cryptocurrency exchange sites.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    Since Surpay was coded to have a database that separates the two different sets of users (survey takers and 
                    survey distributors), the team and I decided to use a condensed login component with a additional steps for users 
                    to interact with. I chose modals over individual login pages for the interface because of their simplicity and easy 
                    navigation. They also allow users to exit the login and quickly return to the homepage if they want to explore more 
                    of the application before making an account or logging in.

                    to use a layout with double the amount of login steps because of how the database was set up. I chose modals
                    rather than individual pages because of their simplicity, easy navigation, and allowing the users to still see the 
                    homepage.

                    Both dashboards will have the same layout - the only difference between the two are the functionalities and what
                    they have access to. We wanted to individualize survey taker's dashboard from the distributor's so users who access 
                    both will be able to immediately identify which account they are logged into. To accomplish this, different 
                    design assets were chosen for the login modal image and dashboard background (as shown below in the 'High Fidelity Prototype 
                    & Asset Designs' section).

                    I began the process by creating a wireframe for the homepage, using Wireframe.cc. From there, I created the 6 modals:
                    a modal that asks which type of user they are, distributor login & account creation, survey taker login & account 
                    creation, and create a new account. After users select their status, it directs them to the corresponding login. A link was added under the forms
                    to send new users to the account creation modal. This design allowed us to have one less modal for users to go through if they 
                    already have an account.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    After completing this step, I moved onto the dashboards. Each dashboard had a welcome banner message. There were two concepts that I had in mind: 
                    1. a page with large navigation buttons and 2. a page that had a left sided navigation bar with each page content 
                    being displayed on the right hand side. I then divided the rest of the designs by dashboards: the distributors and the 
                    survey takers.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSizeTitle"><b>Distributor Dashboard:</b></p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    The distributor dashboard consisted of 4 options: 'Create a New Survey','Launch A Past Survey','Manage a Survey', and
                    'Account Settings'. Buttons were designed to be located in the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page  in 
                    order to make each selection distinct from one another.
                    Once a survey is completed, users are taken to the 'Manage a Survey' section where a success message,number of users completed, 
                    fund amount, and survey link will be displayed. The users will be able to end any of 
                    the surveys they are currently taking by clicking on the 'End Survey' button. However, in order to end the survey, a safety modal will pop up, asking
                    users to enter in their password before confirming the deletion. This was also done with the account deletion in the 'Account
                    Settings' tab. I added this safety feature to prevent users from accidentally ending their survey process or accidentally
                    deleting their account.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSizeTitle"><b>Survey Taker Dashboard:</b></p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    The survey taker dashboard consists of 3 user options:'Take a Survey', 'Previous Surveys Taken', and 'Account Settings'. When
                    selecting a survey to take, users will have two options: entering a survey link into a textbox or searching a dropdown list of active surveys. 
                    If the user does not have a wallet attached to their account, an alert will pop up with a button that takes them to the 'Attach Wallet' section
                    in 'Account Settings'. The surveys will consist of one page and up to 4 modals. The first modal contains a captcha in order to block out 
                    any bots trying to complete the surveys. The second modal is attached to the close button, asking users if they really want to end the
                    survey and it will give them an alert that lets them know their responses will not be saved. The third modal alerts users to complete all questions if there were any left 
                    blank when the pressed the submit button. Finally, the fourth modal displays a success message after they press submit. It will also
                    contain a button that will take users back to their dashboard. As for the 'Previous Surveys Taken' section, there are 2 designs:
                    one for users that haven't taken any surveys and one for users who have previously taken them. The empty survey page will contain a message letting 
                    users know that they have not taken any and the filled survey page will display a list
                    containing information of the date that the survey(s) was taken and their payment status. Both pages will contain a button leading them to
                    the 'Take a Survey' section.

                    Once the basic page layouts were completed, I compiled the wireframe links, screenshots, and descriptions into a PDF file for my

                <p id="fontSize">
                    Once the low fidelity wireframe design was approved and signed off by all members, I moved onto
                    researching for the UI components. This included color schemes, creating an inspiration
                    collage for the digital assets, fonts, and rounded vs sharp edges.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    I wanted the main color for the UI palette to be blue because it traditionally represents trust, professionalism, and is also 
                    a common color for financial institutions. For the additional colors, the team and I wanted to remain within the blue
                    to purple hues because they represent honesty, optimism, loyalty, and reliability. Some of the palette colors were 
                    changed to have a neon tint in order to represent cryptocurrency and to add a bold contrast against the other colors.
                    I struggled with selecting the colors because I wanted the app to have a sense of individualism, yet contain aesthetics
                    of cryptocurrency exchange and survey websites. I started out by using Coolors.io, mixing and matching different blue
                    and neon hues until I had settled with this color palette:

                <p id="fontSize">
                    However, when designing the digital assets, the colors did not have the effect that fit the theme 
                    of the application. It needed cohesive colors for a more professional result.
                </p>

                <p id="fontSize">
                    I reached out to other UXUI designers and was recommended to use Colormind's AI color palette generator. I used it to create  
                    a new color scheme and edited some of the color choices so it could match Surpay's UI. The team and I were satisfied with this new 
                    color palette and it became the application's colors:

                <p id="fontSize">When it came to the creation of high fidelity prototype, I used images from the inspiration collage made in the UI research phase. 
                    I chose a combination of realism and 3D rendered images so that the app has a well-thought-out balance of modern and unique designs (via 3D 
                    renderings) and trust/human feel (via realism images).
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    I used royalty free stock images from Unsplash as fillers for the prototype and later replaced them with my own designs. 
                    For the realism photos, I edited the Unsplash images through Procreate and Photoshop by adding an image of the Surpay 
                    logo on a browser over the device screens. For the dashboard background image, I went with a light grid design on a dark
                    gray background with thin to medium chevron lines in the corner. The chevron lines had a
                    neon glow added to them so that they would stand out. 
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    I wanted to have the background and design assets to carry the color theme 
                    for this application. This allowed for the components to be more subtle, calm, and easy to focus on. It also allows Surpay
                    to update their look later on by replacing the design assets.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    When designing the logo, I used image references of a shield (to represent protection/security), gears and squares/rectangles 
                    (to represent cryptocurrency), and checkboxes (to represent surveys).
                </p>

                <p id="fontSize">
                    The team chose to proceed with option two. When it came time to turn the sketch into the official logo, I used big name company logos (such as Apple, Nike,
                    Windows, etc.) as a reference to give the logo a minimalist feel yet contain everything you need to know about the company. In
                    order to achieve that, I filled in the wallet color with a shade of black, changed the text color to white, and added 2 white lines
                    at the bottom left hand corner for some distinction. <b>This was the end result:</b>

                    The high fidelity prototype helped put the entire application and all of its components into perspective. Once we were able to interact 
                    with the Figma prototype, we were able to narrow down on which elements were fully necessary and which ones we could omit. It
                    also helped the developers plan and organize the layout of the code. For example, it didn't cross our minds that we would need
                    2 extra modals for login assistance (one to send a reset password to the user's email and one to display a success message with a 
                    button leading to the third modal to change the password). It also helped me realize that re-launching a survey would need
                    a safety modal because it is asking for users to type in their password to confirm the relaunch.
