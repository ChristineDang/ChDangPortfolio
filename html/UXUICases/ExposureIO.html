                We used the waterfall methodology and tracked the process through Microsoft Excel. As part of the research and design team, we split our tasks into 4 sections:
                <b>basic layout research, low fidelity wireframe design, detailed research for design and UI concepts, user testing and analysis,</b> and <b>HiFi prototype.</b>
                I met with Elise & Madeleine via Discord and we spent time brainstorming and planning different components of the app. We all started off with conducting individual 
                product research before combining our findings.

                    My <b>first step</b> included researching similar social media applications that focus on photos and/or photography. These included Instagram, Flickr, and Pinterest.
                    I narrowed it down to these three applications because they are currently the most popular on the market
                    and all three have a similar aesthetic and user experience we were going for. I took notes of their layouts, color palettes, user 
                    experience, and navigation. I made sure to write down the layout differences and understand the reasoning to their design choices, since they each 
                    cater to different user niches. While digging through these apps,
                    one question came to mind about their layouts: were these design choices chosen to fit their aesthetics or were they chosen 
                    to avoid copyright infringement from each other?

                    We wanted users to use ExposureIO for <b>inspiration</b>, as a <b>learning tool/guide</b> to help build their 
                    photography skills and portfolios, and as a place to <b>increase their presence</b> online as an artist. Whether
                    they are on the app for a few minutes or a few hours per day, we want users to be able to gain something that is beneficial 
                    to their time and knowledge.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    We all really liked the modern design of instagram's explore page (with 2 different size images), and the detailed 
                    image layouts of Pinterest and Flickr. 
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    A <b>possible issue</b> we ran into with our image layout concept is that the images in the larger tiles might take 
                    most of the attention away from the smaller tiles. Looking at how Instagram created their layout, we believe they combatted this issue 
                    by making the larger tiles contain videos while the smaller tiles contain images and short videos. This pattern trains the user's 
                    mind to pay attention to both large and small tiles. <b>Our solutions:</b> I came up with having the larger tiles contain 
                    slideshows of a user's photos, while Madeleine came up with the idea of separating each chunk of rows by individual users (so each user would have 1 
                    large tile image and 5 smaller tile images surrounding it). Both of our ideas brought a different look to the app, so we planned on 
                    creating the high fidelity prototype of each design to test in a survey after the wireframes were completed.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    During the creation of the <b>sitemap</b>, we wanted to stick to the generic layout of image based social media apps. That way, users can 
                    quickly familiarize themselves with the app. It will start at the 'Login/Create Account' page, and then lead users to the 'Explore Page/Dashboard'. 
                    This page will be the main focal point of the app so that users could absorb more than one image at a time and select which photo genre they 
                    feel like viewing. The bottom of each page will contain a floating navigation bar with icons in the following order: explore/dashboard, search,
                    images liked, and account page. The navigation bar will be layered over the bottom portion of the user images as they scroll through the page
                    in order to give a waterfall effect. The 'Images Liked' page will save all of the user's liked images so that they can easily come back to them at 
                    a later date.

                    Once the sitemap and vision were approved by all members, we moved onto researching UI components for the application. 
                    This included color schemes, researching other app's image layouts, fonts, and rounded vs sharp edges.

                <p id="fontSize">
                   While looking at Instagram's color palette on the US Brand Colors website, I noticed that they stick to the left hand
                   side of the color psychology wheel. Their colors include, royal blue ($405DE6), blue (#5B51D8), purple (#833AB4),
                   dark pink (#C13584), purple-red (#E1306C), red (#FD1D1D), dark orange (#F56040),
                   orange (#F77737), yellow (#FCAF45), and light yellow (#FFDC80). These colors represent the following: 
                   optimism, loyalty, reliability, power, elegance, excitement, desire, cheerfulness, and stimulation. 
                   Not only do these colors capture what the app represents, it also brings a bright and young look to the app, 
                   capturing user's attention as they tap on the icon to open it.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    Flickr on the other hand has only 2 colors: true blue (#0063DC) and bright pink (#FF0084). These colors represent loyalty
                    and elegance. This tells us that they are bringing trust, professionalism, and an older feel to their app compared to 
                    other Instagram. One of the things that Flickr focuses on providing for their users is the ability to share photos with their 
                    friends and family. This can be seen through their older style layout for their image gallery. Their images fully fit in each tile, 
                    with their sizing based on whether the images are portrait or landscape mode. The images also display descriptions at the bottom of 
                    when users hover over them with a mouse. Their layout reminds me of Myspace and Facebook's old photo album layout.
                </p>

                <p id="fontSize">
                    As for Pinterest, they use red (#E60023) and white (#FFFFFF). According to the color psychology wheel, the red represents excitement 
                    while the white represents purity and integrity. Pinterest users browse through the app to get new ideas and brainstorm for projects, 
                    which can bring excitement to their research process. With the added title at the bottom of each image, it allows users to 
                    quickly gain more insight of an image that captured their attention. After users select an image, the description section contains links 
                    that allows their users to research more into the image's content.
                </p>

                <p id="fontSize">
                    The team and I briefly discussed the color palette and we all agreed that we wanted subtle colors as the app's secondary colors and black
                    and white as the primary colors. Instagram's use of bright colors added a youthful and positive feel, but using a bright palette
                    with more than 3 or 4 colors didn't fit with the professional and older aspect we were leaning towards. Flickr's colors 
                    were closer to the idea we had in mind, especially with their muted tones. Finally, Pinterest colors have the bold style
                    we wanted in ExposureIO's secondary colors.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    However, when designing the digital assets, this color palette did not match the design we were going for. We wanted it to look more 
                    simplistic and straight forward, and the palette did not have a professional tone we were going for. This led us to looking at colors on
                    the black and white scale. According to Tailor Brands and Writing Explained, Black and white represents a company
                    having "very defined ideas that will not be changed" and "a clear message and authority". For ExposureIO, black and
                    white also represents a blank canvas for artists to add color and expression to. In the end, we chose the colors
                    black (#000000), jet (#313131), gainsboro (#DDDFDE), and white (#FFFFFF). Black and white will be our primary colors while jet and 
                    gainsboro will be our secondary colors. Choosing these four colors gives us a nice gradient to work with. It also allows us to not have to
                    fully depend on pure white and black, since they can be harsh on the eyes. There was a thought to change the tones for the black 
                    and white so they wouldn't be as harsh, but the boldness of those shades added the strength and depth ExposureIO was looking for. As long 
                    as the primary colors are balanced with all the components of the UI, then those colors should not have that problem.

                    During my research on fonts, I found that Instagram created and uses their own font called Instagram Sans (Instagram about page). 
                    Flickr uses Frutiger (information retrieved from Fontinlogo), and Pinterest uses helvetica/neue haas grotesk (information retrieved from Sitepoint). 
                    We knew that in order to choose a font for ExposureIO, we have to choose one that makes our app distinctive, legible for all audiences, 
                    and matches the aesthetic of the app. This allowed us to quickly remove any of the free flowing fonts like Chalkboard and cursive, 
                    thin/condensed fonts like Open Sans Condensed, and typewriter fonts. We wanted a modern font that portrays a level of professionalism, 
                    while being plain/subtle enough so that the user's images can stand out. We chose 2 Google fonts each and discussed what drew us to 
                    selecting them. While all the fonts we chose were very similar to one another, we narrowed it down to oxygen & Rubik because we liked their letter spacing. 
                    In the end, we went with <b>oxygen</b> because it had a lighter weight and narrower lettering compared to Rubik.

                    Each user's uploaded image will have sharp edge corners because they are the 'important content boxes'. We balanced this

                    I began the process by using Mockflow to create a wireframe for the homepage. By using Mockflow, it allowed me to <b>familiarize myself 
                    with another software</b> and add <b>hand-sketch feel</b> to the low fidelity. 
                    Even though there are 2 different ideas for what goes into the large tiles, the rest of the layout will remain the same. A few things I kept in 
                    mind while designing the page layouts include keeping the structure simple and organized so that the images won't look cluttered, making sure 
                    that everything is symmetrical and balanced to one another, have the user interface be easy to navigate through, and incorporate a modern look and 
                    flow to peak the interest of users.

                <p id="fontSizeTitle"><b>Home/Explore Page:</b></p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    The 'Home/Explore' page will be the main focal point of the application. It will contain 1 large tile that takes up 2 rows of smaller tiles. The rows that 
                    contain a large tile will have a total of 3 tiles (1 large and 2 small). There will also be one row of 3 small tiles in between each row 
                    that contains a large tile. This layout creates more balance between each component and does not clutter the 'Home/Explore' page. If 
                    more small tile rows were added in between each large tile row, it might create a maximalist feel to the page. Underneath the 'Explore' title,
                    there will be a right-to-left scrollable section, containing the following text categories: Portrait, Nature, Food, Minimal, Art, and 
                    Architecture. Based on our user tests, these might be changed to list them in alphabetical order or by popularity.

                <p id="fontSizeTitle"><b>Selected Image Page:</b></p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    The 'Selected Image' page will contain a large tile with the image displayed at the top. It will also contain the title, photographer's name, 
                    description box, and a right-to-left scrollable section at the bottom, displaying images that are similar to the one that the user selected. 
                    A study from Hootsuite - titled 'Ideal Length of Social Media Posts: A Guide for Every Platform' - found that social media posts should have the 
                    ideal length of 200 characters to prevent captions from being truncated. Pinterest allows users to have up to 200 characters and Instagram allows users 
                    to have up to 2,200 characters. We couldn't find details about Flickr's character limit, but from a few forums on their website, users have said there is 
                    a 2,500 word limit. With this knowledge in mind, we planned to set our limit to 2,000 words in order to give users the opportunity to describe their 
                    process in full. The title will also have a limit of 300 characters. This decision was based on Flickr's 255 character title limit and Twitter's old 280 
                    character limit. The title text will be bold to capture the user's attention, and the photographer's name will be smaller and lighter, to 
                    contrast from the 3 text-containing sections. There will be a light gray line separating the description box from the 'Similar Images'
                    to further emphasize the section change. Similar images will be smaller and in one row to prevent distracting users.

                    The 'Liked Images' page will have each image take up most of the screen and display the title and photographer's name underneath.
                    Users will be able to scroll/swipe from a bottom-to-top direction in order to look through the images they've liked. Each image will also be clickable
                    and will take users to the 'selected Image' page. We went with this concept design in order to differentiate it from the 'Home/Explore' page 
                    so users won't get confused with which page they are currently browsing through. The liked photos will also contain the theme navigation 
                    bar at the top of the page (under the "Liked" title), and the photos will still be organized by those categories. This concept design 
                    was chosen to make the pages more cohesive with one another.

                    We conducted our surveys at the University of Florida's Plaza of the Americas and STEM building. We chose this location 
                    because our target demographic are university students (undergraduate to PhD levels). 
                    With our iPads and laptops in hand, we approached potential users, had them interact with the HiFi prototypes, and
                    asked questions to get their opinions on the app. 
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    We aimed for a gender balance among our user tests since the app is for everyone. For the age range, we chose at least 18+ in order
                    to cater to more professional users with an interest in photography. However, we do not plan on restricting underaged users who are 
                    interested in photography from creating an account. Recording the user's career/major helped us understand what 
                    outlook they were coming from. It could also help us find that there is a deeper niche for the application
                    usage rather than just for photography enthusiasts. Adding the user's first name and initial of their last name would help us build a character 
                    storyline and make it more realistic rather than having the users be labeled by numbers.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    In order to come up with our questions, we kept the following in mind: receive open ended answers, find out why users engage or choose 
                    not to engage with the app, how we could make the app easier to use, which version users prefer, and how to increase the 
                    overall user satisfaction with the app.

                    Upon the completion of our user test, we found that there was not a large preference for one version over the other. Some people
                    preferred the line separation because it made the page look more organized, while others preferred the slideshow effect because it added movement to the page.
                    There was a surprising number of people that didn't have a preference (32%) between the two and we did not expect for 20% of users to not be able to tell 
                    the difference between the two versions. While 24% preferred version 1.0 and 24% preferred version 1.5, there was a higher percentage of 
                    people not being able to tell the difference or not having a preference (52%). This helped us choose to stick with the original
                    design because the possible issue we thought would arise was not an issue at all.

                    The majority of users we tested enjoyed their experience with the HiFi prototypes (68%) and mentioned that they would use the app. The rest who disliked, 
                    felt neutral, or had no applicable answers for us (combined 32%) brought up new ideas, issues, and things we didn't think about incorporating 
                    for ease of use and more enjoyment. Examples include: wanting a comments section, not having a button in the navigation bar to post images,
                    the length of categories in the top navigation bar, how would users find new users to follow, and how having the dot underneath the

                    images. We added a mailbox button on the 'Explore Page' to give users the option to reach out to others if they are interested in hiring them, 
                    learning more about their process, and/or for collaboration. In order for users to find more people to follow, we'll mix in non-followed user images 
                    in their feed. Finally, for the dot in the category navbar, we'll change it to a scroll bar for a comprehensive design. Our other changes
                    include shrinking the white space & adding a 'Post Image' button in the main navbar. Since our main focus was on the 'Homepage', 'Selected Image Page',
                    and 'Liked Images Page', we saved our other responses for building out the other pages at a later date.

                <p id="fontSize">
                    With the user test results, notes, and plan in hand, I move forward with editing the high fidelity prototype. 
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    I used royalty free stock images from Unsplash as fillers to represent images our users would post. In the bottom floating navbar, 
                    A camera shutter icon was added to take users to the page where they can post their images. This was chosen
                    because the camera icon is commonly used on mobile devices to open the camera apps. Even though our functionality 
                    only allows users to post photos from their file/storage, we chose not to use a file icon because it isn't commonly used or as easy to
                    understand as the camera shutter icon. We kept the floating bottom navbar with beveled edges to give the app 
                    a waterfall effect as users scroll through the pages. When a user has reached the bottom of the page, the bottom navbar will 
                    sit on top of white space and there will be a small resistance bounce to let them know they 
                    cannot scroll down any further.

                <p id="fontSizeTitle"><b>Animations and small touches:</b></p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    As users navigate from page to page, the gray icons in the bottom navbar will turn black and contain a small black dot underneath. This will 
                    let users know what page they are currently viewing. Maneuvering around each section and page uses Figma's "smart animate" feature because the majority
                    of the layers match up between each page and we wanted the transition to be smooth instead of harsh like the 'instant' option.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    When liking an image, the empty heart icon at the top right hand corner will fill up. The heart icon in the bottom navbar will
                    have a small red dot that fades in and slightly bounces upward in the upper right hand corner of the icon. This animated design was chosen 
                    to subtly notify users that they have something new saved in their 'Liked Page'. Since it is a low priority notification, we didn't want
                    the heart and dot to be larger or more animated.
                </p>
                <p id="fontSize">
                    A light gray scroll bar was added to replace the black dot in the top category navbar. We wanted it light enough so it wouldn't distract users 
                    from the labels, but dark enough so that they know how far they have scrolled and which direction they can scroll to. The category that 
                    users are on will always be the first text on the left, with black text instead of light gray (like the others). This will give the design 
                    a consistent feel and users will be able to quickly glance at that corner to know what page they are on, rather than having to spend time 
                    searching for it among the other listed categories.
                </p>

                    There you have it! A functioning high fidelity prototype for the ExposureIO application. Overall, it was a great project to work on. It was 
                    a lot of fun coming up with new and modern takes for a social media photography app while using current apps for reference. The research and user 
                    testing phase was very insightful. It reaffirmed that humans are a creature of habit and that it could be difficult to bring a product like this into the 
                    market without proper marketing, a captivating user interface, and a unique user experience. ExposureIO has given me new knowledge and skills that I will be carrying into future
                    projects and assignments.
