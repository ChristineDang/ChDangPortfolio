                    We used the <b>Agile methodology</b> and tracked our process by using <b>Trello</b>. As the researcher, designer, and 
                    front-end developer, I split my tasks into 4 sections: <b>basic layout & research, low fidelity wireframe design, detailed UI research,</b> 
                    and <b>coding the front-end of the application.</b> Mike and I met up on Slack three times a week to go over our research
                    and our progress. While I researched the user interface, Mike looked into the user experience by seeing which coding 
                    packages and functions we could implement. We used food delivery services as our references, but added our own touches 
                    of home cooking and a sense of community to it.

                    My first steps included researching popular food delivery companies.
                    These included Doordash, UberEats, GrubHub, and Postmates. I took notes of their layouts, color palettes, user 
                    experience, and navigation. While the focal point is food delivery and navigations/themes were all pretty similar, 
                    they all differentiated from one another by their choice in what topic they wanted to focus on when users first enter
                    their homepage. For example, UberEats draws attention to creating business accounts, hiring delivery drivers, and adding
                    more restaurants to their list. Doordash focuses on hiring delivery drivers and becoming a partner with them. GrubHub on
                    the other hand focuses on supporting local restaurants, 'local favorites', and giving users perks when using their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next category I researched were chain-restaurants. This included Chili's, Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse, and Dominos. 
                    While they all have different themes (based on what they sell), the one thing they have in common is the large and vibrant food images. I 
                    noticed that this is not as prominent in food delivery applications. All four restaurant websites allowed users to add one of the dishes 
                    to their cart before choosing the location that is nearest to them. Once users are ready to check out, they are given the option to pick up
                    their order from the restaurant or get it delivered by the restaurant's delivery service. Some have even teamed up with a food delivery company to
                    take care of the deliveries (example: Chili's partnership with Doordash).

                    Since restaurants were closed due to the 2020 Covid pandemic, people had to rely on cooking & preparing 
                    their own food. The ones who relied on eating out had to pick up cooking skills and the ones who 
                    ordered out as a treat or break from cooking didn't have that convenience anymore. Mike and I wanted to create 
                    a solution to this problem by allowing neighbors to open their doors to one another (metaphorically, of course)
                    by sharing dishes. This would also allow people who cook to make a little extra money by selling their dishes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When developing with Home-Cooks' concept, we double checked the legality of our vision, and found that it is legal in the 
                    state of Florida and California to sell dishes made in a home kitchen. We checked these two states because it is where we 
                    each currently reside. When it came to the design, we wanted it to look modern and focus on the topic of food. 
                    I researched UberEats, Doordash, GrubHub, and Postmates and used their UX/UI as references. I made notes to implement images, 
                    background images, and animations that had an upbeat feel similar to the other food delivery apps, but that have more of a "home 
                    cooked meal" concept. These included (but not limited to) a kitchen background image, home cooked dish images, and cooking pan animation.
                    We chose for the application to be light themed in order to portray a clean and safe environment. This will give users a sense of trust in 
                    the food that they're ordering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application will be fairly simplistic and will have a homepage that leads to 2 different areas: home cooks (people selling
                    their home-cooked meals) and eaters (people looking to order food).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Home cooks:</b> Users will be taken to a page where they will be asked to enter in their dish information. This includes their name, 
                    the dish's name, ingredients, cost, address, phone number, number of servings, and payment type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Eaters:</b> Users will be taken to the implemented Google Maps API that will display what dishes are available for 
                    purchase. Once they select a dish, and be taken to their cart and checkout page.

                <p>
                    I began the process by creating a wireframe for the application using Wireframe Pro. I created a total of 5 pages:
                    Homepage, Cooks, Eat 1, Eat 2, and Checkout.
                </p>
                <p><b>Homepage:</b></p>
                <p>
                    We wanted the homepage to be as simplistic as possible, mimicking the feel of other delivery applications. This would allow users to 
                    navigate easier, faster, and smoother through the app. I kept in mind that when users are feeling "hangry", the quicker their food 
                    ordering process is, the better. Designing the application to have a lot of information similar to restaurant sites didn't fit the concept 
                    of Home-Cooks because the application contains dishes from different individuals and having more information than necessary would 
                    be distracting for Home-Cooks' UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We omitted the navigation bar from the homepage because having the option of 'Cooks', 'Eat', and 'Checkout' were not needed 
                    until the user selects one of the two main categories. Instead, there will be a 'Get Started' button that will automatically scroll users 
                    to the main section of the page, since the banner will take up about half of the homepage when users enter the app. The main section of the 
                    page will have 2 parts - Cooks & Eat - with a similar layout: A LottieFiles gif, brief description of the selection, and a button that 
                    takes the user to the next page based on the selection they choose. For the footer, there will be two buttons: one that leads to Mike's 
                    GitHub page and the other to my GitHub page. This will be temporary until the app gets further developed.
                </p>
                <p><b>Cooks Page:</b></p>
                <p>
                    The cooks page will have forms for the user's to enter in their dish information. These include name, email address, address for pickup, the name of the dish, 
                    serving size, price, payment type, an image to represent the dish, and ingredients list. Users can enter in their home address or 
                    choose a meeting spot to exchange their dish. The ingredients list must be filled out, to prevent 'Eat' users from having allergic 
                    reactions. This concept does have a few safety <b>risks</b> with meeting others to exchange cooked dishes for US dollars, but since we only
                    had two weeks to come up with and code a fully functioning application, we kept it as is. An <b>idea</b> we could <b>implement in the future</b>
                    to help with these safety issues is teaming up with a neighborhood app like Nextdoor or apartment complex websites so people can 
                    only purchase from a small area of their community. We could also have people create accounts and profiles with star ratings, as an 
                    extra security/safety measure for people to know which 'Chefs' are verified. Another <b>future implementation</b> we could add is an option where 
                    'Cooks' select an allergen icon that is in their dish and it would be displayed on that dish's card for the 'Eat' users to see.
                </p>
                <p><b>Eat, Pages 1 & 2:</b></p>
                <p>
                    The first page that users are taken to when selecting 'Eat' is the Google Maps API page. Here, dishes being sold nearby will be displayed 
                    within a close radius to their current location. We didn't have a lot of design options for this page because it uses Google's API, 
                    so we went with their design/layout. We chose Google Maps API because it's a well known application and trusted by many users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second page will show a large card, containing all of the descriptions the 'Cooks' have entered for their dish. These include an image, name of dish, 
                    chef's name, ingredients, and serving size. Users will then have 3 button options on each card: add to cart, checkout, and back. The 'back' button will take 
                    users back to the Google Maps page, where they can select another dish to add to their cart. If the user is ready to make the purchase, then they can select 
                    'checkout' and be taken to the checkout page. The 'add to cart' button will add the dish to their cart and will keep the users on that page until they select 
                    one of the other buttons.
                </p>
                <p><b>Checkout:</b></p>
                <p>
                    The function of our checkout page allows users to finalize their selection before confirming which dish they want 
                    to order. It will have a section that displays each dish the user has added to their cart. In that section, there will be an image of the dish,
                    description, and 2 buttons: delete and checkout. If users wish to add more dishes to their list, they can select 'Eat' 
                    in the navigation bar. This will take them back to the Google Maps API so that they can add more to their cart. None of the user's dishes 
                    in their shopping cart will be removed unless they delete it from their list. This method allows users to see and compare their selected dishes 
                    all on one page, in order to help them make an easier decision on what to choose. We decided to only let users purchase one dish at a time
                    to prevent people from spamming purchases and the 'Cooks' from having no shows. Since there is not an account functionality, the saved items in the 
                    checkout will be stored in the user's cookies.

                    Once the low fidelity wireframe design was approved, I moved onto researching UI components: the
                    primary palette, surface colors, background colors/images, fonts, icons, animated components, and buttons
                </p>
                <p><b>Color Palette:</b></p>
                <p>
                    When selecting colors for the primary palette, we wanted them to resemble the traditional colors of a kitchen. According to 
                    KraftMaid.com's article, "Traditional Style Spotlight: The Traditional Kitchen", these colors have warm and earthy tones that make the 
                    environment feel welcoming and familiar. On top of the warm and earthy tones, we also wanted there to be a contrast of dark to light 
                    colors. Rather than choosing one or more colors from the color psychology wheel, I went with mute tones in order for the background 
                    and surface colors to add contrast. I wanted to tell a story with the background by using realistic photos. We went with #252525 eerie black
                    (softer and less bold compared to #000000), #F8F4EB floral white, and #FFFFFF white. #BBA795 Grullo was added to the list 
                    so we could use different shades of it for the secondary, surface, and background colors. According to thoughtco.com, the 
                    color beige is seen as a traditional color that symbolizes work and simplicity in modern times. Tan - according to 
                    picsart.com - represents stability, growth, warmth, honesty, and reliability among others because of its association with 
                    the earth. These descriptions fit the image we wanted Home-Cooks to have.

                <p><b>Surface & Background colors/Images:</b></p>
                <p>
                    In order to represent home cooking to our users, we chose realistic images for our surface and background images. Studies have shown that 
                    realistic photos on websites allow for better engagement with visitors ("4 reasons your website should include real photos", Delux.com/blog).
                    To match our color palette and add a rustic design to the application, I went with cutting boards and bold colored vegetables for the forms 
                    and information page backgrounds. These designs help represent the idea of preparing food in a home kitchen. To tell a story through the app, 
                    I designed the homepage to start out in a brightly lit kitchen. Users will be taken to the 'prep' phase where they will see a chopping board background 
                    when they post their dish or are looking to make a purchase. Finally, they will end up in a warm and bright café checkout in order to
                    bring users the excitement they get when ordering takeout from restaurants, even though the food is home cooked.

                <p><b>Animated Components, buttons, Icons:</b></p>
                <p>
                    To add a touch of movement to the website, I used LottieFiles' <b>animated gifs</b> on the homepage of the application. Having the 
                    animations helps attract the users attention and brings the app to life. I looked for gifs pertaining to cooking and plates of food 
                    in order to match the theme's two options. For the 'Cooks' gif, I looked for a simplistic design of a kitchen tool 
                    that a majority of people have used in their home. This ended up being the green frying pan that is tossing a mix of veggies. For the 
                    'Eat' gif, I went with an animation that had 3 dishes in rotation in front of a solid circle background. This design helps depict to users that 
                    Home-Cooks offer a variety of different cuisines. 

                    The animated gifs added a nice balance with the realistic background image on the homepage. Since our color palette has mute colors 
                    and the image on the homepage is of a white kitchen - layered with an opaque section so users can read the text - I was able 
                    to select any colored gif without having to worry about clashing colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the semi opaque cards contain the dish information and shopping cart items, I designed those cards and the forms to have sharp corners in order to 
                    show the level of importance. We went with rounded corner <b>buttons</b> for contrast. The homepage will have black buttons
                    and white lettering, to stand out from the light background. I didn't want the buttons to interfere with the gif colors on the page.
                    The checkout button in the cart page will also be a black button in order to tie in with the homepage. To submit
                    the form and add/select an item, the buttons will be green. This color represents 'go' and will encourage users to interact and place an order.
                    The last action button, 'remove' in the shopping cart will be yellow because it is not as urgent as red and lets users know to pause before 
                    making the decision to remove a dish from their cart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only <b>icon</b> we have on our page is the shopping cart icon, located in the upper right hand corner of the navbar on the 'Eat' page. 
                    I chose not to include a remove icon in the cart page because I wanted to have another button in order to balance the checkout button. 
                    We had many cart icon options thanks to Iconify and Font Awesome. After narrowing them down to five options (chosen based on their 
                    simplicity, contrast, and rounded edges), we went with option 5 because a solid colored cart stood out the best on our solid 'Eerie Black'
                    navbar. We also chose option 5 over option 3 because its shape better resembles a classic shopping cart.

                <p><b>Fonts:</b></p>
                <p>
                    We went with Copperplate/Copperplate Gothic Light/Fantasy for the application's name because the wide shaped letters and 
                    accent lines on the edges on each one added a fun and unique touch. This made the app stand out from others. 
                    We chose Georgia/Times New Roman/Times/Serif for the rest of the app because they are readable on screens 
                    and it adds an elegant touch to the site.

                <p>
                    Due to the time crunch and having the title of UX/UI designer and front-end developer for this application, I went straight to 
                    coding the application after creating the low fidelity wireframe instead of creating a high fidelity prototype before the coding phase. 
                    With the wireframe complete and the background images, color scheme, icons, animated components, and buttons selected during the UI 
                    research phase, this gave us a clear image of what the app will look like. The Bootstrap library provided us with many different
                    templates for components and I was able to manipulate button and font designs with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used royalty free stock images from Unsplash and Pexels for the three background images and dish image selections. The basic text boxes,
                    modals, and cards were from Bootstrap and I coded the parallax feature on the homepage using CSS. The parallax feature (where the kitchen background image 
                    remained static and the jumbotron along with the top layer with information scrolled over it) helped add depth to the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the bottom of the homepage, I decided to add an audio player for ambiance. The audio consists of 1 track that plays a jazzy dining 
                    tune called 'All That' by Benjamin Tissot on Bensound. I wanted to have the audio playing at around 30% volume when users 
                    first enter the page because it would elevate the ambiance of ordering out/dining. This idea was scratched because having an audio 
                    play automatically on a site has a bad reputation of upsetting users. A few examples of this feature annoying users include: their audio being turned up too loud, 
                    being in a quiet environment, or having another audio source playing. Automatic audio on applications are also associated with gaming applications and 
                    websites, which doesn't fit with Home-Cooks' genre. In the end, we coded an audio player at the bottom of the page for an 'easter egg effect'. This 
                    allows any user to be able to play the audio for their perceived sight, to satisfy their curiosity, and to enhance their experience on the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I enjoyed my experience working on Home-Cooks. It allowed me to combine both of my skills in UX/UI Research, Design, and Full Stack Web Development.
                    If I were to work on this application again for an update, I would look for ways to simplify the user interface, have more solid colors and simpler backgrounds,
                    and add a few more steps in the user experience - such as account creation and the ability for users to write reviews.
